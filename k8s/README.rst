# Running artman as a service on Kubernetes

Artman can be run as a remote service (AaaS) to receive and execute artifact
generation requests. While it can be run anywhere, it can run more easily
on Kubernetes (k8s), via the config files in this folder.

Note: this is an experimental feature, which is used by whitelisted developers
at this moment. We will make it open to everyone very soon.
